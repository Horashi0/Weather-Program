Hello! This is a quick little program I made to get back into python. 

I have also included the most bare bone "original" weather program for you.

To use: 

Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create a account. Then navigate to "My API keys" and create a API key.

Put this API key into the variable API_key and boom! You have a free weather program.
